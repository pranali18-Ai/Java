# Java Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java code examples and exercises designed to help beginners grasp the fundamental concepts of Java programming. Each folder represents a specific topic, and within each folder, you'll find code samples, explanations, and exercises related to that topic.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. variables_datatypes

This folder covers the basics of variables and data types in Java. It includes examples and explanations on how to declare variables, assign values, and work with different data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.

### 2. conditional_statement

The conditional_statement folder contains code examples that demonstrate the usage of conditional statements in Java, such as if-else statements and switch statements. It covers how to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

### 3. loops

In the loops folder, you'll find examples and exercises related to loops in Java. It covers different types of loops, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop. You'll learn how to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met.

### 4. operators

The operators folder contains code examples illustrating the usage of various operators in Java, such as arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators, and assignment operators. It explains how to perform mathematical computations and manipulate values using operators.

### 5. patterns(I)

The patterns(I) folder focuses on creating patterns using Java. It includes examples and exercises on printing various patterns using loops and nested loops. This helps you develop your understanding of loops and their applications in creating different patterns.

### 6. arrays

The arrays folder covers the concept of arrays in Java. It provides code examples and exercises on how to declare, initialize, access, and manipulate arrays in Java. You'll learn how to work with single-dimensional arrays as well as multi-dimensional arrays.

## How to Use

Each folder contains its own set of code examples and exercises. You can navigate to the specific folder of your interest and explore the code files within. Read the comments within the code for explanations and run the examples to observe the output.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different values, and challenge yourself with the exercises provided. The repository is designed to help you gain hands-on experience and strengthen your understanding of Java programming concepts.
